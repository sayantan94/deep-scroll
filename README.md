DeepScroll

An AI-powered web bot that scrolls endlessly, observes intelligently, and extracts signal from dynamic pages.

DeepScroll is an AI bot that autonomously scrolls dynamic web pages (infinite feeds, long lists, timelines), detects newly loaded content, extracts structured information, and persists it for downstream analysis or agent workflows.

It’s designed to replace manual doom-scrolling with intentional, automated collection.

Code to follow soon.
